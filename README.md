# Ant-Optimization
End of Year Project for Algorithms class, Y2S2

This is my solution to a Travelling Salesman Problem. I used Ant Optimization Problem to save shorter paths in pheromone matrix. Data is taken in the form of GPS coordinates, parsed from a .csv document. This project ended in top 77% of the class.
